## Features and Notes

The `Token Note Hover` module displays the note of a hovered-over token in a tooltip. Links, images and scrolling in the tooltip are supported.

The tooltip will not display while the token is being dragged.

*The module currently only supports [D&D 5E](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dnd5e) and [Ironsworn/Starforged](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundry-ironsworn).*

The module provides some customization options in the settings:

* Tooltip themes (Ironsworn/Starforged only)
* Placement, display delay, display window size and font size customization
* Show/hide note images for tooltip display
* Can require minimum token ownership level on notes for display

All settings, except for `token ownership required` are client-side only so each player can enable the features they need.
