# Features and Notes
The `Token Note Hover` module displays the note of a hovered-over token.

*The module currently only supports Ironsworn and Ironsworn: Starforged.*

It provides some basic customization options in the settings, such as a light theme and a dark theme.

All settings, including `enable module` are client-side only so each player must enable the features they need.
